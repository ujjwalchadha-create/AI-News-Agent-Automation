# AI News Agent Automation

This project leverages Zapier automation to discover, summarize, and post the latest drone and UAV technology news to social media.

## Steps Automated

1. **News Discovery:** Fetches daily articles on "drone news," "UAV technology," and "DGCA drones India" via Google News RSS in Zapier.
2. **AI Summarization:** Optionally integrates with an AI API for content summarization (future step).
3. **Social Media Posting:** Formats and auto-posts to LinkedIn, Twitter, or saves for review.

## Repository Structure

- `/workflows` – Zapier workflow JSON exports and configuration
- `/scripts` – Any helper scripts if needed
- `/docs` – Screenshots and project documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Review the README and folder structure.
3. Import the Zapier workflow (if available) to recreate automation.

This repository demonstrates a real-world use case for AI and automation tools in news aggregation and social posting.
